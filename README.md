## 📌 How It Works

- Each tab is represented by a `<span class="tab">` element  
- Each tab has a corresponding content section with class `.tab-content`  
- JavaScript listens for tab clicks  
- When a tab is clicked:
  - The active class is removed from all tabs  
  - The active class is added to the clicked tab  
  - Only the matching content section is displayed
